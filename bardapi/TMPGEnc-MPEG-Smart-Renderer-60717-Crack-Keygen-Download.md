To use TMPGEnc MPEG Smart Renderer, you need a valid license key that you can purchase from the official website. However, if you want to try it for free, you can use a keygen tool that generates a serial number for you. A keygen is a program that creates unique codes based on a specific algorithm. You can use these codes to activate the software and enjoy its full features.
 
However, using a keygen is not recommended as it may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. Moreover, it is illegal and unethical to use a keygen as it violates the copyright of the software developer. Therefore, you should avoid using a keygen and instead buy a legitimate license key from the official website.
